## Object Detection topics in OpenCV

    -> Cascade Classifier :- Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method.
                             It is basically a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.
